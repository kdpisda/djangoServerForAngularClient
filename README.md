## Server for angular client

Server for [angular client](https://github.com/kdpisda/angularClientDjango)

The aim of the project is to make an open source CMS made in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Angular](https://angular.io). Basically it will use angular as front end and django as back end.

I have a very simple aim to make an API driven app. Based on Django and Angular. Django will serve as back end of the application. It will be responsible for providing API's to Angular Client. Angular will be used as front end of the application. Since it will be API driven it will easily be customizable. Further suggestions are welcomed.

## Application Front end

The front end for the server may be found at [djangoServerForAngularClient](https://github.com/kdpisda/angularClientDjango).

## Running server in localhost

If you are using ubuntu or any linux flavour then follow this procedure.
> Make sure you have git installed in your system

Run following commands in terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kdpisda/djangoServerForAngularClient
$ source env/bin/activate
$ ./manage.py runserver
```

Now open your browser and visit `127.0.0.1:8000`

Currently we are working on the architecture of the application. It will be uploaded soon.
